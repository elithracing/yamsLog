* Serial log to console

Test serial communication first, is it an elm??
-------------------------------------------------

Steps:
1) Test dev-file availability (typically /dev/ttyUSB0)
2) Connect to device, ask simple questions, possibly autobaud, try multiple 
   times
3) Find out what protocol car speaks (Only once)
3) Check capabilities (Only once)
4) Start logging
5) If connection lost: (car turned off gives "NO DATA"), try 2), then if it works try 4) again. If 2) fails, close file and retry availability
6) Repeat 5) as long as connection is bad.
