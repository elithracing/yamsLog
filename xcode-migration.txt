Short document describing the steps to add XCode-IDE support to the
project

Some of the steps are highly local to your
boost/protobuf-installation, modify as expected


1. Added header search paths to boost and protobuf
2. Added library search paths to boost and protobuf
3. Turned of warning for implicit conversion to 32 bit type
4. Added $(SOURCE_ROOT)/server/yamsLogd/src/ to header search path
5. Removed can-sensor and other linux-specific source files from the
build
6. Added libraries: protobuf, boost_filesystem, boost_thread,
boost_system to the link phase
7. Added a copy files rule for the min_max_server_values.txt and
port_config.txt resource files
